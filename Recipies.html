        <h1>Beef Keema with Yogurt (Ground Beef)</h1>
        <p>This rich beef keema gets its creamy texture and slight tartness from being cooked with yogurt instead of tomatoes. It's a great recipe for keema lovers who are looking to switch up their recipe rotation.</p>

        <h1>EQUIPMENT</h1>
        <p>1 Heavy bottom pot</p>
        
        <h1>INGREDIENTS</h1>
        <ol>
        <li>⅓ cup neutral oil</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        <li>1 black cardamom</li>
        <li>4 cloves</li>
        <li>½ inch cinnamon stick</li>
        <li>1 large yellow onion thinly sliced in half rings</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ginger and garlic paste</li>
        <li>2 to 4 chilies or to taste sliced lengthwise</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon turmeric powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cumin powder</li>
        <li>2 teaspoon coriander powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon red chili powder</li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1 ¼ teaspoon salt or to taste</li>
        <li>1 cup full-fat yogurt whisked and brought to room temperature</li>
        </ol>
        
        <H1>INSTRUCTIONS</H1>
         
        <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a heavy bottom pot. Once it begins to shimmer, add whole spices (bay leaf, black cardamom, cloves and cinnamon stick) and fry on medium to medium-low heat for 30 seconds or until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add onions and sauté until evenly brown for 7 to 12 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add crushed ginger and garlic and fry for 30 seconds. Take care not to let it burn. Stir in green chilies.</li>
        <li>Add ground spices (turmeric, coriander, cumin and red chili powder) fry for 1 minute. Deglaze the pan with a splash of water (1 tablespoon at a time) if and as needed.</li>
        <li>Increase heat to medium to medium high, and add ground beef and salt. Crumble with wooden spatula and fry until no longer pink, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add ½ cup room temperature water and bring to a simmer. Lower heat, cover and let the beef cook for 30 minutes. Stir occasionally to make sure it doesn't stick to the bottom of the pan. Once done, remove cover and let it simmer to boil out any excess moisture. Check for salt and adjust as needed.</li>
        <li>Fold in yogurt and stir continuously on medium-low heat for about 8 to 10 minutes until the oil begins to separate from the keema and you get the desired texture.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat, place in serving platter and garnish with finely chopped cilantro and chilies. Serve with roti or plain basmati rice.</li>

        <img src="https://foodfusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Chapli-kabab-Recipe-by-Food-fusion-1.jpg" alt="">

       <h1>Ingredients</h1>
       <ul> 
        <li>6 tbsp coriander seeds</li>
        <li>2 tbsp cumin seeds</li>
        <li>3 bay leaf, whole</li>
        <li>6 tbsp wheat flour or gram flour (atta or besan)</li>
        <li>1 large onion, finely diced</li>
        <li>2 medium tomatoes, all the seeds and insides removed, finely diced</li>
        <li>8 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 tbsp ginger, minced</li>
        <li>4 chopped green chillies</li>
        <li>3 tbsp dried pomegranate seeds (anardana)</li>
        <li>2 tsp chilli flakes</li>
        <li>1 tsp black pepper (ideally coarsely ground)</li>
        <li>0.5 tsp turmeric</li>
        <li>0.25 tsp carom seeds (ajwain)</li>
        <li>3 tsp salt (or to taste)</li>
        <li>1 tbsp dried fenugreek (kasoori methi) OR 2 tbsp fresh fenugreek, chopped</li>
        <li>1 handful of coriander, chopped</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1kg minced meat (see notes for more information about what kind of meat)</li>
        <li>Oil or beef tallow, for frying</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Instructions</h1>
        <ol>
        <li>Gently preheat a dry pan over a medium to high heat, then add the coriander seeds, cumin seeds and bay leaf. Stir this gently in the pan, allowing the seeds to toast. Once the spices become fragrant and toasted, remove from the heat and grind coarsely in a coffee grinder or pestle and mortar. Ideally, you want to the spices to keep some texture. Set aside in a large mixing bowl</li>
        <li>In the same pan, add the wheat flour/gram flour and toast this too, stirring constantly, until it too become fragrant and the colour darkens slightly. Remove from the heat and add to the large mixing bowl</li>
        <li>Add in all the ingredients to the large mixing bowl except for the minced meat and oil. Mix everything together well.</li>
        <li>Add the minced meat to the mixing bowl. Incorporate everything together well - you may find your hands do a better job of this than a spoon.</li>
        <li>Form the minced meat mixture into large patties. See the post for tips on how to form these.</li>
        <li>When ready to fry, heat up enough oil in a frying pan to form a small layer. Add the kababs and fry them over a medium heat, flipping after 6-8 minutes.</li>
        <p> Your kababs are ready! Serve alongside some naan, a salad and chutney!</p>

        <h1>INGREDIENTS</h1>
        <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup oil</li>
        <li>2 medium onions, diced finely</li>
        <li>2 tbsp tomato concentrate OR two medium tomatoes, finely diced</li>
        <li>8 bullet chillies</li>
        <li>juice from half a lemon</li>
        <li>3 tsp chaat masala</li>
        <li>fresh coriander, for garnishing</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Chicken marination</h2>
        <ul>
            
          <li>1 tsp nigella seeds (kalonji)</li>
          <li>1 tsp fennel seeds (saunf)</li>
          <li>1 tsp cumin seeds (zeera)</li>
          <li>1.5 tsp black mustard seeds (rai)</li>
          <li>1 chicken (about 800g), bone in, skinless, curry cut</li>
          <li>1/2 cup/120g full fat yogurt</li>
          <li>2 tsp coriander powder</li>
          <li>6 green chillies (Thai bird eye or finger chilli - the slim variety of chillies), ground into a paste (about 1 tsp)
            6 garlic cloves, ground into a paste/2 tsp garlic paste</li>
          <li>1 tsp ginger paste</li>
          <li>1.5 tsp salt, or to taste</li>
          <li>0.5 tsp turmeric</li>
          </ul>  

          <h3>Instructions</h3>
          <ol>  
          <li>Grind the nigella seeds, fennel seeds, cumin seeds and mustard seeds in a pestle and mortar or spice grinder until fine</li>
          <li>Prepare the marination: mix together all the marination ingredients and set aside for at least 4 hours and a maximum of 24 hours</li>
          <li>When ready to start cooking, add the oil into a deep pan or pot. Once heated, add in the diced onions and sauté them over a medium to high heat until the onions become brown</li>
          <li>Add in the marinated chicken. Sauté this until the chicken no longer remains pink and any water released from the yogurt concentrates. It'll look pretty dry when this step is completed. Keep stirring over a medium to high heat to ensure it doesn't burn</li>
          <li>Add the tomato concentrate/tomatoes. If using tomato concentrate, also add 1/2 cup/125mls water too. Cover and simmer everything over a low heat for 25 minutes</li>
          <li>As the chicken is cooking, prepare the green chillies. Mix the lemon juice and chaat masala, then set aside. Use a knife to create a slit down the centre of the chilli, then apply pressure to the top and bottom to open up the slit. Insert 2-3 tsp of the lemon and chaat masala mixture into the chillies, then set aside</li>
          <li>Once the cook time for the chicken is up, uncover and add in the chillies. Allow the chillies to cook alongside everything for 5 minutes</li>
          <p>Your Achari Chicken is ready! Garnish with fresh coriander before serving</p>
